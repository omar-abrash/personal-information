i was graduated as a chemical engineer in (2011) I has (very good grad), the graduation project for me in (matlab programing),
but i am learning programing from (12/2020) to change my carrer.

I like the programing languges more than any things, the (front-end website field) is good thing to statrt from it.
 
I think is need more time and effort to learn every thing about it, so i will spend my time in it.
