My name is Omar Abrash, and I am 36 years old from Jordan. I graduated as a chemical engineer in 2011 with a very good grade. My graduation project involved MATLAB programming.

I started working as a Frontend Developer in freelance jobs in 2020. I like programming languages more than anything else. The front-end web development field is a good starting point.

I believe that learning everything about this field requires time and effort, so I am dedicating my time to it. If I find it suitable for me, I will continue pursuing it.

After one year...

I have earned a nanodegree in the front-end field and have solid knowledge in backend development with the Node.js stack. I have worked on many projects across various industries, including learning, e-commerce, and fintech. Additionally, I have developed many mobile apps using React Native.

Here's a JavaScript code snippet:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
const myField = true;
if ( myField ) {
	console.log ("this is perfect filed for me.");
}else{
        console.log("it must perfect for me ^_^.");
}

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
